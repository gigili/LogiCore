# Data Cable

## Data Cable

<ItemImage id="logicore:data_cable" />

The backbone of any computing infrastructure. The Data Cable is a hybrid conduit capable of interfacing with both internal machines and external power sources.

It provides a bidirectional link: delivering energy to your hardware and retrieving computational [Cycles](../architecture/cycles.md) in return.

## Network Topology

Data Cables handle network creation automatically.

Placing a cable in isolation instantiates a new, unique network. However, placing a cable adjacent to an existing line will cause it to merge instantly with that network.

Use this to link power generators to your [Server Racks](../machines/server_rack.md) and [Computers](../machines/computer.md).

Cheap and efficient, these cables allow for complex routing between your power generation and your server room.
