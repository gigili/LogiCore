# Cycles

## What are Cycles?

[Cycles](./cycles.md) represent the computational throughput of your network.

Unlike energy (FE), which is consumed to do work, Cycles are *produced* by doing work. They are an abstract resource used to quantify the processing power of your setup.

## Generation & Usage

Cycles are generated by [Server Racks](../machines/server_rack.md) and [Computers](../machines/computer.md).

The rate of generation depends on the hardware tier. These cycles flow through the [Data Cables](../components/data_cable.md) and are essential for operating advanced network tasks.
