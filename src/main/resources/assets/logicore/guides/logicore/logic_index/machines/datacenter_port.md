# Datacenter Port

## Datacenter Port

<ItemImage id="logicore:datacenter_port" />

The Datacenter Port is the primary input/output interface for the [Datacenter](../architecture/datacenter.md) multiblock
structure. It allows you to extract the immense computational power generated by the structure.

## Placement

This block must be placed as part of the Datacenter's walls. Once the structure is formed, the Port will become active.

Connect [Data Cables](../components/data_cable.md) to this port to distribute the
generated [Cycles](../architecture/cycles.md) to your network.

## Capacity

Unlike standard machines, the Port has direct access to the Datacenter's massive internal buffer.

Multiple ports can be installed on a single structure to increase the total throughput or to create separate
sub-networks.

A high-bandwidth interface module for massive data transfer.
