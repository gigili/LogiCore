# Research station

## Research station

<ItemImage id="logicore:research_station" />

Before you are able to reproduce an item based on their [Cycles](../architecture/cycles.md) value, you must first
analyze it with the Research station. The research station will analyze the item and store it's knowledge about it so
that it can be reproduced.

The research process is dependent on the cycle cost. The more expensive the item is, the longer the research it takes.
Default config values allows for a maximum of 600 ticks (or 30 seconds) for the longest research process.All
non-researched items will have a tooltip that says 'Not researched' or 'Researched' if it was already learned.
